# Data Pagination and Filtering
 
## Description: 
 'Data Pagination and Filtering', as the name suggests, is a web application prototype which:
1. Performs customized pagination of data.
2.  and filters data based on the input provided.

The project is coded in JavaScript along with the pre-written starter files in HTML and CSS.

### Code Description:
1. showPage function provides required number of data items on a default web page [In this case 9 data Items]
2. addPagination function adds pagination features, making the data Items to be stored on that particular page and display only when clicked on its button.
3. Search bar is created and functionality is added using performSearch function. PerformSearch function retrieves data matched based on the input entered. If no matches are found, the "No results found" message is displayed.
4. For dynamic search, keyup event listener, apart from the search button, is added. This features shows results in real-time, further reducing the delay in finding the results.



## Project Purpose:
To display a small amound data on a web page, we can scroll through to browse the data. But if there is a large amount of data displayed on the web page, the user experience will be terrible to traverse through the data. For example, if we need to browse through the content to watch a movie on Netflix, it will be tiring to scroll through till the movie is found. For better user experience and to make things easier, the web site should have basic pagination. To make the user experience even better and simple, search option is a must to browse the content in a seconds of time. This project gives a solution to access required content in a matter of seconds by adding both the pagination and filtering features.
